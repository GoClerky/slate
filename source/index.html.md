# Introduction

Welcome to the Clerky API! You can use our API to access Kittn API endpoints, which can get information on various cats, kittens, and breeds in our database.

We have language bindings in Shell, Ruby, and Python! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

This example API documentation page was created with [Slate](https://github.com/tripit/slate). Feel free to edit it and use it as a base for your own API's documentation.

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
```

## Tags

Tags create the logic and control flow for templates. They are denoted by curly braces and percent signs: {% and %}.

The markup used in tags does not produce any visible text. This means that you can assign variables and create conditions and loops without showing any of the Liquid logic on the page.


{% if user %}
  Hello {{ user.name }}!
{% endif %}


> To authorize, use this code:

```html
{% if user %}
  Hello {{ user.name }}!
{% endif %}
```




## Filters





> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby

# Email Templates

> To authorize, use this code:

```ruby
require 'kittn'

api = Kittn::APIClient.authorize!('meowmeowmeow')
```

```python
import kittn

api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow')
```

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: meowmeowmeow"
```

```javascript
const kittn = require('kittn');

let api = kittn.authorize('meowmeowmeow');
```

> Make sure to replace `meowmeowmeow` with your API key.

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Kittn expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: meowmeowmeow`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>meowmeowmeow</code> with your personal API key.
